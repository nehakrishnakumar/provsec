# provsec
Package of different lean proofs/ideas that all address the domain of security. This will most likely only include a set of examples of how security can be proved in Lean, and is not intended to be used for a specific case-study of an application. AWS security-related code is intended to be analyzed and verified here using the Lean theorem prover.
